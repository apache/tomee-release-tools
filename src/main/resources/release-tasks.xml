  <task summary="Ensure TCK is passing (NDA)">
    A signed NDA is required for this step.
    This can be done either by viewing the latest results in EC2 or running the TCK locally (several hours)

  <task summary="Publish RAT report" >
    There is a rat scan file in the root of the trunk source:

      http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openejb/trunk/openejb/rat.xml

    ant -f rat.xml
  </task>
  <task summary="Add missing license headers" >
    The rat.xml file may not be up to date. Use caution when it indicates
    a file does not have an ASL header.

    All java files should have headers without exception, however some
    files should not have headers and some do not need them.

    Do not add headers to any user configuration files such as 'ejbd.properties'
    or the default 'tomee.xml'. Simply add these to the excludes section of
    the rat.xml file if a new one is added and not put in the excludes.

    Any files that are just one or two lines are generated from trivial
    source do not need headers. Headers are only required for files
    that represent unique IP. Trivial files do not need headers. Headers
    can be added or the file can be added to the excludes. Either one.
